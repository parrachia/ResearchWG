# Intro: DAOincubator & genDAO

## Formal onboarding of the DAOincubator in the genDAO

The DAOincubator is both a vehicle for DAO research and a resource for helping others in the space to launch and run DAOs of their own.

You can find out more about us [here](http://daoincubator.org). 

### Proposal Description

As a group of researchers and advisors, DAOincubator would like to be hosted on Alchemy as part of the genDAO polity, with its experiments and ecosystem coordination efforts. Beyond the experimental value, this subDAO would formalize bilateral relations between DAOincubator and the genDAO to enable reciprocal agreements through proposals in the incubator subDAO on Alchemy. Bridging between the wider DAOstack community as a technology provider and DAOincubator as a technology-agnostic entity to foster the DAOspace and carry its potential to real world applications. It is expected that immersing DAOincubator in the DAOstack ecosystem will result in a productive and mutually-beneficial exchange, contributing towards cross-community exchange, cross-platform integration and eventually increased maturity of the DAOspace as a whole. If this proposal is to be accepted, this will become the first meaningful interDAO linkage.

### The Incubator’s subDAO

\# of participants: 20-30

The Incubator subDAO will consist of the members of DAOincubator’s working group, who are selected on their merits in accordance with the incubator’s onboarding protocol. As of today \(7.04\), DAOincubator WG consists of 22 members. We expect that number to approach 30 as we complete our self-incubation process.

### Objectives:

By crystallizing into its own governance entity, DAOincubator aims to:

* Flexibly experiment with its own governance and holographic consensus
* Reward its members with reputation for completion of tasks
* Start onboarding through Alchemy dapp
* Become a functional part of the genDAO

### Expected Outcomes:

* Onboard preDAOs to the DAOstack ecosystem
* Corroborate with the vision of genDAO as coordinatorDAO for the mentioned ecosystem
* Present relevant findings publicly \(medium, twitter, alchemy statement and more\)
* As an entity, open precedence as 1st non human reputation owner
* Raise awareness on genesisDAO and DAOstack as supporters of the Incubator

### Funds & Reputation:

For its bootstrapping, DAOincubator would ask for 500 USD and 1% reputation.

The funding shall be handled as a budget for the Incubator subDAO that, by means of its own governance, will be transparently managed towards the above listed objectives and outcomes.
