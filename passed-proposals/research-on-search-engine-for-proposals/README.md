# Research on Search Engine for Proposals

## Proposal

[Original Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iw7BA5aIsjuHNxi9DeZyHtatLNPw5tYYrkfNARQmVK0/edit)

### Expected Outcomes 

* Uncover all relevant proposals around a specific topic so that we aren’t duplicating efforts with the upcoming [proposal for research](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pQrfzQMafzrsXt66ZzJBTjm20qeLXoUFX51ptRywLm4/edit#gid=1194219037) \([discussion on DAOtalk](https://daotalk.org/t/case-studies-decentralized-orgs-with-on-chain-governance/395)\)
* Propose heuristics for future attempts at “proposals archeology”
* Be the start of a potential project for categorizing and sorting proposals semantically  

#### Deliverables:

1. Report of findings and analysis of results \(in both editable and pdf formats\)
2. Spreadsheet of findings \(interacting with [proposal tracking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FV8iz4ebZb4E3nXckzPsWy7IfhtsX3filkbX_gbPLNs/edit#gid=1899049180)\)
3. Recommendations for creation of a search engine/process

## Deliveries

### Key findings

* The current proposal repository system is inadequate for long-term record-keeping, accountability, and management. In fact, it is not a repository at all, as the proposals are not even stored in one account.
  * the issue is aggravated by the simultaneously offchain \(usually gdocs\) and onchain \(Alchemy and DAOstack stack\) aspects of proposals
  * an alternative that offers both ease of use and scaling capabilities is still lacking. 
  * we believe that a git based solution with some kind of open-source middleware could offer a viable candidate for solid medium-term solutions
* Unlike other DAOs, the Genesis DAO does not focus on code. In fact, it’s the only DAO that does any industry research or marketing research at all. Generally anything having to do with marketing plans is centralized — in other words planning and marketing tend to be centralized by Aragon, Zcash, DASH, and DAOstack, if at all, rather than by the grants-based DAOs they have created.
  * Regarding that, we identified multiple past proposals that could have benefited from a DAO landscape mapping, something that helps illustrate the importance of such research.
* The proposals were fairly random, with an emphasis on marketing, particularly documentation and communications, with a few events.
  * By analyzing the proposals using the taxonomy and the tags proposed here against a structured [vision](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10-0ppf_QpYdlBC_AFWt-QhJWyUpBRl5zU9bU1AWXUqU/edit#heading=h.ggo559linbt0) and [budget planning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fyhXSv_yp38FbC-R3aJPqqVJDvi6i0LATZya5F9vtZ4/edit), we may better understand the gaps and opportunities to become a more effective and cohesive group.
* Doing the neck test was a healthy exercise that should be available to more DAO citizens and at a lower attention cost. Developing a proposal search engine could dramatically improve coordination and the proposal quality
