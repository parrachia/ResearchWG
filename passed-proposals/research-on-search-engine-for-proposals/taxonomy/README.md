# Taxonomy

#### Help define the proposal taxonomy

By building off a baseline framework, we invite members of the genDAO to continue the work developing  a clear definition and scope of the proposal concept that:

* Educates and clearly defines in non-technical and across industry terms
* Establishes a common set of terms and definitions for use by business and technical participants
* Creates a tagging system  that is simple to understand, organize and navigate
* Decomposes tokens into parts to power a framework for mixing and matching, driving reuse and innovation
