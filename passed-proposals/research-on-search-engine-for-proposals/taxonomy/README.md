# Taxonomy

#### Help define the proposal taxonomy

By building off a baseline framework, we invite members of the genDAO to continue the work developing  a clear definition and scope of the proposal concept that:

* Educates and clearly defines in non-technical and across industry terms
* Establishes a common set of terms and definitions for use by business and technical participants
* Creates a tagging system that is simple to understand, organize and navigate
* Decomposes proposals into parts to power a framework for mixing and matching, driving reuse and innovation

Even though this model might leave an impression of being too rigid, we would like to acknowledge that, like yin & yang:

* **Financial** proposals have nonFinancial implications according to the concept of "budget as policy";
* **nonFinancial** proposals have financial externalities like unaccounted researching, the value of proposal writing in itself, or simply external funding;
* **External** proposals have internal implications as they should leave breadcrumbs and artifacts for future efforts like opening precedents;
* **Internal** proposals have external implications as all of them are public and transparent;
