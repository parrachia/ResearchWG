## Proposal Research

### Exploring Genesis' Past

We reviewed the past of genDAO proposals to understand what has been done so far. So we don't needlessly repeat work, and also so that we can get an idea of the realms of the work that the Collective Intelligence is funding. We also reviewed briefly the history of other DAOs \(Aragon, Dash, Zcash\) to compare what they fund against what Genesis has been funding.

By creating a taxonomy for the different areas of the DAO funding, we hope to be able to spawn the creating of better accountability tools, e.g. a search function for past proposals, or a process where we can better visualize and identify gaps and focuses. To our understanding, the first application would be to create a better repository for proposals, as well as switching from collaborating tools such as Google Docs.

The most claimant finding was the current state of the Genesis Proposals repository. It is inadequate for any kind of meaningful search or categorization. Based on this research, in the following findings, we believe that improving and building new tools around this area should be of the highest priority to the DAO.

### Key findings

* The current proposal repository system is inadequate for long-term record-keeping, accountability, and management. In fact, it is not a repository at all, as the proposals are not even stored in one account.
  * the issue is aggravated by the simultaneously offchain \(usually gdocs\) and onchain \(Alchemy and DAOstack stack\) aspects of proposals
  * an alternative that offers both ease of use and scaling capabilities is still lacking. 
  * we believe that a git based solution with some kind of open-source middleware could offer a viable candidate for solid medium-term solutions
* Unlike other DAOs, the Genesis DAO does not focus on code. In fact, it’s the only DAO that does any industry research or marketing research at all. Generally anything having to do with marketing plans is centralized — in other words planning and marketing tend to be centralized by Aragon, Zcash, DASH, and DAOstack, if at all, rather than by the grants-based DAOs they have created.
  * Regarding that, we identified multiple past proposals that could have benefited from a DAO landscape mapping, something that helps illustrate the importance of such research.
* The proposals were fairly random, with an emphasis on marketing, particularly documentation and communications, with a few events.
  * By analyzing the proposals using the taxonomy and the tags proposed here against a structured [vision](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10-0ppf_QpYdlBC_AFWt-QhJWyUpBRl5zU9bU1AWXUqU/edit#heading=h.ggo559linbt0) and [budget planning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fyhXSv_yp38FbC-R3aJPqqVJDvi6i0LATZya5F9vtZ4/edit), we may better understand the gaps and opportunities to become a more effective and cohesive group.
* Doing the neck test was a healthy exercise that should be available to more DAO citizens and at a lower attention cost. Developing a proposal search engine could dramatically improve coordination and the proposal quality 

## **Taxonomy**

### **Basic taxonomy**

The basic taxonomy for the project divides the proposals into those who asked for money \(financial\) and those who asked for no money or rep only \(non-financial\). The second axis was the external versus internal axis, where external projects are designated as anything that doesn’t affect the DAO directly, but is designed for research, bringing in community members, etc. Internal proposals are those that affect the DAO itself, including how the proposals are made, policies, and code.

## **Findings**

### **Basic taxonomy breakdown**

As shown below, most proposals were one-time proposals, and only a quarter of proposals were recurring proposals.

### **Detailed tagging breakdown**

The proposals were read and tagged with numerous tags, depending on the type of work that was being done, the geography and the purpose of the work. The tags used were based on traditional categorization in most companies. The chart below shows an emphasis on marketing and documentation \(often one proposal includes both\). While development was a focus of several proposals, compared to the core development of other projects, and of the DAOstack core team, the amount of development on the Genesis platform is minimal, and much of it was based on improving the Alchemy backend and on interfacing to other platforms.

We did not perform an analysis per-budget.

### Summary 

**Summary of findings for proposal makers**

 Next steps possible:

* Alchemy explorer¹ further developments 
  * 
* Repository of all proposals, searchable
  * 
* Tagging system for repository
  * 
* Categorization, like DASH has, so the budget can be followed as per past allocation 
  * By using the taxonomic apparatus here presented
* Analysis of funds allocated breakdown 
  * As mentioned earlier an improved visualization of proposals, together with a vision and budgeting review, can be of great assistance here
* Analysis of reputation given versus actual use of REP, that is, whether people allocated REP are actually using it.
  * 

> ¹ The authors are concerned about the transparency of voting with the Alchemy Explorer. Anonymous voting allows people to worry less about the political implications of their votes and eliminates people voting for “friends” or people with more power, just to gain favor. We acknowledge the discussion being carried [here](https://daotalk.org/t/private-voting-module/469/2?u=pat).
