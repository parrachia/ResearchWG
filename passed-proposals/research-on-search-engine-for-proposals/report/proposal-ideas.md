# Proposal ideas

Coming from our [key findings](https://app.gitbook.com/@gendao/s/researchwg/~/drafts/-Le4Tkvne7saZ5XO8Znl/primary/passed-proposals/research-on-search-engine-for-proposals/report#key-findings), we identified solution candidates and listed them below as proposal ideas, preProposals and support to existing proposals. 

* **Bounty ideas:** 

  * Proof of Concept for Private Voting on Alchemy
  * Add search functionality to [DAO-explorer](https://dao-explorer.com)
  * Analysis of funds allocated breakdown 
  * Analysis of reputation given versus actual use of REP, that is, whether people allocated REP are actually using it.

* **preProposals:**
  * [Monthly Retrospectives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mS9ORsq647xblKiAxQGdwEJ9PuJnghl-8iBkbVT_NEs/edit?usp=sharing)
  * Search engine, tagging and repository all-in-one solution candidate \(COMING SOON\) 
* **Support for ongoing proposals:**
  * [Creating the first set of GenDAO’s Vision/Objectives/Key Results ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10-0ppf_QpYdlBC_AFWt-QhJWyUpBRl5zU9bU1AWXUqU/edit#heading=h.vaikfqc64l1)
  * [DAO budgeting 101](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fyhXSv_yp38FbC-R3aJPqqVJDvi6i0LATZya5F9vtZ4/edit)
  * DAO Landscape Mapping \(COMING SOON\) 
* We believe that a git based solution with some kind of open-source middleware could offer a viable candidate for solid medium-term solutions
* Regarding that, we identified multiple past proposals that could have benefited from a DAO landscape mapping, something that helps illustrate the importance of such initiative.
* By analyzing the proposals using the taxonomy and the tags proposed here against a structured [vision](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10-0ppf_QpYdlBC_AFWt-QhJWyUpBRl5zU9bU1AWXUqU/edit#heading=h.ggo559linbt0) and [budget planning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fyhXSv_yp38FbC-R3aJPqqVJDvi6i0LATZya5F9vtZ4/edit), we may better understand the gaps and opportunities to become a more effective and cohesive group.
* A well-done and beneficial retrospective/"neck-test" should yield actionable items and occur regularly. They encourage us to improve and prevent costly mistakes by prioritizing genDAOs self-evaluation.



Summary of findings for proposal makers

* Alchemy explorer¹ further developments 
  * Proof of Concept for an Alchemy Private Voting
* Repository of all proposals, searchable
  * Make the DAO explore fetch data from all past genDAO iterations
  * Add search functionality 
* Tagging system
  * 
* Categorization, like DASH has, so the budget can be followed as per past allocation 

{% page-ref page="../../dao-budgeting-101/" %}

* * As mentioned earlier an improved visualization of proposals, together with a vision and budgeting review, can be of great assistance here
* Analysis of funds allocated breakdown 
* Analysis of reputation given versus actual use of REP, that is, whether people allocated REP are actually using it.
* [Monthly Retrospectives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mS9ORsq647xblKiAxQGdwEJ9PuJnghl-8iBkbVT_NEs/edit?usp=sharing)

> ¹ The authors are concerned about the transparency of voting with the Alchemy Explorer. Anonymous voting allows people to worry less about the political implications of their votes and eliminates people voting for “friends” or people with more power, just to gain favor. We acknowledge the discussion being carried [here](https://daotalk.org/t/private-voting-module/469/2?u=pat).
