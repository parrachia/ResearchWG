# ResearchDAO: Rationale

Matan Field - November 12th, 2018

> Hey everyone. This is the beginning of a decentralized DAO\(stack\) research group, to be soon transitioned into a DAO by itself.  
>   
> \*\*\*  
> Please feel free to bring into this group anyone who'd be interested in DAO research and mechanism design \(specifically DAOstack and Holographic Consensus research\): [https://t.me/joinchat/AUo-qA7EQURSFhru0WqvVg](tg://join?invite=AUo-qA7EQURSFhru0WqvVg)  
>   
> This is the place for real-time operational questions and announcements \(the conversation may move to Discord later\), while for any scientific questions, answers and opinions please use the Forum: [https://daotalk.org/c/research](https://daotalk.org/c/research) for the benefit of everyone.

> The decentralized research team is kicked-off with this intensive research week, at the end of which we'll close the first Genesis protocol upgrade.  
>   
> Everyone are warmly invited to take part in this work, and DAOstack is also offering generous bounties for contributions made to the protocol, particularly those that will make it to the implementation. Later on rewards will be implemented via a DAO on Alchemy: [http://alchemy.daostack.io](http://alchemy.daostack.io/) .

> Looking forward to working with all of you! Matan.
