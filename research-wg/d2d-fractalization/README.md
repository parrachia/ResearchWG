# How does a DAO go fractal?

Collaboration at scale is not agent-centric, but rather it gravitates around entities.  However, in the current DAO space, interactions between DAOs often take the form of initiatives by specific members.  In other words, the processes by which individual DAOs translate member sentiment into governance action do not yet accommodate interactions between DAOs.  

With genDAO positioned to assume the role of DAOstack ecosystem coordinator, how can we extend this efficiency beyond self-contained DAOs, so that the ecosystem can develop in a more dynamic and scalable way?  To state the problem in another way, a lack of standardization in the fractalization process could lead to a number of woes, including information asymmetries that threaten to expose us to [adverse selection and even moral-hazard](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-difference-between-moral-hazard-and-adverse-selection.asp).  

To truly open up the possibilities of fractalized DAOs, we need custom tailored onramps that DAOs can use to “plug into” other DAOs.  Certain basic elements of a “minimum viable fractalization” procedure must be defined so that would-be interDAOs are not forced to get too creative or engage in too much guesswork regarding the onboarding process. Besides the actual procedure, a broader and more comprehensive nomenclature is needed, together with updated checks and balances for the new uses of reputation.

## Proposal

We’re at such an early stage as a field/industry that every new application of DAOs to real-life scenarios is a critical opportunity for us to learn what works, what doesn’t, when and why.

Exploring nested DAO structures enables a tight feedback loop of hypothesis creation, testing and iteration as we co-design these novel forms of collective organization. For example, we hypothesize that the “templates” mentioned here will emerge from patterns of functions and forms shared 

\(a\) between platforms’ native DAO \(e.g. genDAO\) and its subDAOs   
\(b\) across subDAOs within a platform   
\(c\) among DAO stakeholders \(individual and collective member entities, e.g. DAOincubator\)\]  
\(d\) interoperable across platforms

### Objectives

* Foment the discussion around D2D interactions and fractalization in a open and participative way
* Document initial best practices for DAOs to onboard other DAOs by signaling, screening and decentralized reputation managing
* Later on, test those best practices by both:
  * onboading the DAOincubator and
  * facilitate other DAOs to join through a series of workshops

</table>## Outcomes

#### 1st Draft + AMA

Our 1st draft covered the initial structured thoughts about the necessary nomenclature, the outline of the onboarding procedure and a problem-solution proposition.

The AMA was started in the DAOtalk forum but ended up happening in the GDocs. _**Feel free to comment and ask anything on both channels.**_

### Onboarding procedure

#### Screening

Firstly a DAO that wants to join genDAO should have a clear, collective understanding of the protocol, Vision and access to key resources. Right now the closest thing we have is the DAO Hub [here](https://hub.gendao.org/) [hub.gendao.org](https://hub.gendao.org/) but as the DAO matures so will the resources for fractalizing candidates to screen for vital information.

#### Signaling

We have only but scratched the surface for the shapes and activities a DAO can take. And as such we should avoid constraining the possibilities for their signalling. Our effort here was to list as many templates and guidelines as possible. Basically offering different formats to answer the Who, What, Why, Where, When of the DAO candidate. All optional by definition but solid baselines nevertheless:

* [Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_ZpLF6b9gUJF2SgqB6sSkKGCa4NGl_Xhj6YjbrAEOm0/edit)
* [Video \(recorded/live\) guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oilPFlKq13So82LxYouvmoiNNVH1VE7rKfwCsaTLyLA/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Pitch Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_4nQIFb4fxnbV4r49ctkurgOxD5rgzj5gZBCtFPEdlc/edit?usp=sharing) \(originally by Eric Arsenault and DMO\)
* "Vanilla" proposals

### Nomenclature

The fractalization of DAOs has several implications on the topology of the DAO space, in the sense that a series of new DAO forms become possible once DAOs can join DAOs.  We’ve taken a stab at defining these DAO forms and some related concepts, and assigned preliminary names to them.

{% page-ref page="nomenclature.md" %}

### Swarming

A new attack vector, native to fractalized DAOs. 

If too many members of one or more interDAO join genDAO to the point of tipping some balance, allowing for biased, unbalanced voting power in detriment of other interDAOs and even the main DAO itself.

Mitigation: "trusted setup", make sure as many trusted interDAO members join, increasing that threshold as much as possible.

Thanks Eric Arsenaut for multiple contributions including highlighting a possible case of fractal swarming.
