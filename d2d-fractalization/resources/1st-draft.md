## How does a DAO go fractal? 

What follows is our initial assessment of how genesisDAO can “fractalize” by accepting other DAOs as members, as promised in this Alchemy [vote](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x294f999356ed03347c7a23bcbcf8d33fa41dc830/proposal/0x335a462c458fa06fa6d400cfdb3ebd309e3800e6014df1e6d4ba52673c3c4e81).  


To begin with, the onboarding procedure itself must be sketched out from start to finish.  We believe that the ritual will look something like this:  


## genDAO's fractalizing rituals

On the applicantDAO side...

* **A new template** for both:
  * **screening** 
    * The incoming DAO’s members have to understand where they're getting into
      * At a minimum, this means reading all \[official\] documentation on the fractalizing ritual and being acquainted with genDAO’s general onboarding procedures
      * They must accept/agree to abide by those of our core practices and values that we’ve determined to be non-negotiable
      * They must agree to abide by our reputation cap 
        * limit on the total amount of cumulative rep that any member is allowed to hold, both standard rep and derivative rep \(defined below\)
      * They must agree to use a specific setup of a multisig and/or alchemy tooling in order to participate in the voting process
  * **signaling** DAOs that want to apply can start the process by filling out a template, which will contain a list of questions like these.  This “template” could be an actual form, or a pre-recorded video, or a live video presentation.
    * who?
      * Who is this incoming DAO?  Which of their members already belong to genDAO?
    * what?
      * What’s the purpose of their DAO?  And, if applicable, their business model/DAOmodel?
    * when?
      * What is the DAO’s internal roadmap?  Separately, what is their roadmap relative to genDAO?
    * where?
      * which jurisdictions are involved, which corners of the cyberspace the candidate DAO touches
    * why?
      * Why join genesis DAO?
      * Why join as a DAO rather than as several individuals?
        * In what way do they understand themselves to be a DAO? 
* **feedback** optional but encouraged, especially in high stakes cases
  * AMAs
  * DAOtalk thread
* **Alchemy proposal** just like any individual would have to submit. 
  * Applicants should include a link to the filled-out template, preferably with any relevant AMAs/DAOtalk threads

On the genDAO side...

* mechanisms to keep these DAOs in check
  * checks and balances
    * to help resist and mitigate rep loopholes \(e.g. rep cap exploits\)
    * to help ensure the health of the ecosystem

The fractalization of DAOs has several implications on the topology of the DAO space, in the sense that a series of new DAO forms become possible once DAOs can join DAOs.  We’ve taken a stab at defining these DAO forms and some related concepts, and assigned preliminary names to them.  


## Nomenclature

### preDAO

A preDAO is, quite simply, an aspirational DAO -- a group of individuals who have organized themselves around the task of building a DAO, but have not yet achieved some arbitrary critical mass of decentralization and autonomy. It also references to the ancient Taoist concept of “[Pre Heaven](https://www.tinyatdragon.com/blogs/spiritual/pre-heaven-and-post-heaven-in-taoism)” - as a space of potentiality.  

### Fractalizing

Having a DAO as a member of another DAO.  


There are 2 main ways that a DAO can fractalize: one is the emergence of a DAO inside another DAO, and the other is for one DAO to grant another DAO voting power.

### subDAO

The literal fractal DAO; one which exists inside a DAO, such that all of its operations are contained within that “parent” DAO.

### interDAO

A DAO which holds voting power in genDAO but is not a subDAO of genDAO, i.e. it also operates outside of genDAO.

### DAO ambassadorship

This occurs when aliceDAO instructs one or more of its members to join bobDAO in order to consolidate membership within bobDAO without joining it as an interDAO.  


### Derivative reputation \(dRep\)

A measure of the amount of reputation power that individuals wield in a DAO as a result of belonging to an interDAO that’s a member of it.  


So, to situate this discussion in the context of the larger picture, why are we concerning ourselves with establishing a procedure for fractalizing genDAO?  


## What can fractalization do for us?

### problem

Collaboration at scale is not agent-centric, but rather it gravitates around entities.  However, in the current DAO space, interactions between DAOs often take the form of initiatives by specific members.  In other words, the processes by which individual DAOs translate member sentiment into governance action do not yet accommodate interactions between DAOs.  With genDAO positioned to assume the role of DAOstack ecosystem coordinator, how can we extend this efficiency beyond self-contained DAOs, so that the ecosystem can develop in a more dynamic and scalable way?  To state the problem in another way, a lack of standardization in the fractalization process could lead to a number of woes, including information asymmetries that threaten to expose us to [adverse selection and even moral-hazard](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-difference-between-moral-hazard-and-adverse-selection.asp).  

### solution

To truly open up the possibilities of fractalized DAOs, we need custom tailored onramps that DAOs can use to “plug into” other DAOs.  Certain basic elements of a “minimum viable fractalization” procedure must be defined so that would-be interDAOs are not forced to get too creative or engage in too much guesswork regarding the onboarding process. Besides the actual procedure, a broader and more comprehensive nomenclature is needed, together with updated checks and balances for the use of reputation.
