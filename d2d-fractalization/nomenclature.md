# Nomenclature

### preDAO

A preDAO is, quite simply, an aspirational DAO -- a group of individuals who have organized themselves around the task of building a DAO, but have not yet achieved some arbitrary critical mass of decentralization and autonomy. It also references to the ancient Taoist concept of “[Pre Heaven](https://www.tinyatdragon.com/blogs/spiritual/pre-heaven-and-post-heaven-in-taoism)” - as a space of potentiality.  

### Fractalizing

Having a DAO as a member of another DAO.

There are 2 main ways that a DAO can fractalize: one is the emergence of a DAO inside another DAO, and the other is for one DAO to grant another DAO voting power.

### subDAO

The literal fractal DAO; one which exists inside a DAO, such that all of its operations are contained within that “parent” DAO.

### interDAO

A DAO which holds voting power in genDAO but is not a subDAO of genDAO, i.e. it also operates outside of genDAO.

### DAO ambassadorship

This occurs when aliceDAO instructs one or more of its members to join bobDAO in order to consolidate membership within bobDAO without joining it as an interDAO.

### Derivative reputation \(dRep\)

A measure of the amount of reputation power that individuals wield in a DAO as a result of belonging to an interDAO that’s a member of it.
